## Scripts

### [zotero-bulk-edit](https://github.com/thalient-ai/zotero-scripts/tree/main/zotero-bulk-edit)

- Search and replace text within fields.
- Supports a wide range of fields including titles, abstracts, creator names, and notes.

**Usage:**
1. Choose the field you want to edit.
2. Enter the search term and replacement term.
3. Select the items to edit (selected items, items in a collection, or items in a saved search).

### [zotero-attachment-rename](https://github.com/thalient-ai/zotero-scripts/tree/main/zotero-attachment-rename)

This script renames attachment filenames and titles based on their parent itemâ€™s metadata. \

**Features:**
- Rename attachment filenames.
- Rename attachment titles.
- Option to rename both filenames and titles.

**Usage:**
1. Choose the items to rename (selected items, items in a collection, or items in a saved search).
2. Choose whether to rename filenames, titles, or both.

### zotero-duplicate-enhanced

This script helps in detecting and handling potential duplicate items based on a similarity threshold.

**Features:**
- Set a similarity threshold for detecting duplicates.
- Compare various fields such as titles, authors, dates, and publishers.
- Tag or move duplicates to the trash.

**Usage:**
1. Set the similarity threshold.
2. Choose the items to compare (selected items, items in a collection, or items in a saved search).
3. Review and handle the detected duplicates.

### zotero-batch-tag

This script helps manage tags within your Zotero library by allowing you to perform bulk operations, such as adding, removing, or replacing tags across multiple items. This script is designed to handle large collections efficiently while providing detailed feedback and user confirmations.

**Features:**
- Add one or more tags to multiple selected items at once.
- Remove specific tags from multiple selected items with a confirmation prompt before execution.
- Replace one tag with another across multiple selected items, ensuring only items with the original tag are modified.
- Detailed Logging: Provides progress feedback and logs detailed actions taken for each item.
- User Confirmation: Prompts for confirmation before performing significant operations like removing or replacing tags.

**Usage:**
1. **Select Items**:
   - The script prompts you to choose items to process: selected items, items in the current collection, or items from a saved search.

2. **Choose Operation**:
   - Add a Tag: Prompts for the tag to be added and applies it to the selected items.
   - Remove a Tag: Prompts for the tag to be removed, confirms the action, and removes it from the selected items.
   - Replace a Tag: Prompts for the old tag and the new tag, confirms the action, and replaces the old tag with the new tag in the selected items.

3. **Confirmation and Progress**:
   - For remove and replace operations, the script provides a confirmation prompt with details on the number of items affected.
